# Keyboard Parts Library

A collection of various KiCad footprints used to create mechanical keyboards.

All the footprints come from various sources and have been tested in my designs and approved by myself.

* Elite-C footprints come from [Keebio](https://github.com/keebio/Keebio-Parts.pretty). The schematic has been modified by myself to add the 4 pins from the Elite-C. Tested and approved in my [Odyssey67 PCB](https://github.com/aureliengmichaud/Odyssey67).
* Arduino ProMicro footprints come from [Biacco42](https://github.com/Biacco42/ProMicroKiCad).
* Switches footprints come from [ai03](https://github.com/ai03-2725/MX_Alps_Hybrid).
